# VPA Auto Creation Controller

This Kubernetes controller automatically creates a `VerticalPodAutoscaler` (VPA) resource for any `Deployment`, `DaemonSet`, or `StatefulSet` that opts in using an annotation.

## Features

- Auto-creates VPA for annotated workloads;
- Cleans up orphaned VPAs;
- Sets `OwnerReference` for automatic VPA deletion;
- Supports Deployments, DaemonSets, and StatefulSets.

## Image

The controller is built for multi-arch hosts and is available `sindvero/vpauto-creation-controller`

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- go version v1.22.0+
- docker version 17.03+.
- kubectl version v1.11.3+.
- Access to a Kubernetes v1.11.3+ cluster;
- Vertical Pod Autoscaller controller and CRDs installed.

### Deploy the controller

The manifests can be found under [./config/manager/](./config/manager/). You can deployed the manager with those manifest using kustomize.

### How It Works

Any `Deployment`, `DaemonSet`, or `StatefulSet` with this annotation:

```yaml
metadata:
  annotations:
    k8s.autoscaling.vpacreation/vpa-enabled: "true"
```

will automatically get a matching [VPA resource](https://github.com/kubernetes/autoscaler/tree/master/vertical-pod-autoscaler).

When the workload is deleted, the VPA is also deleted automatically.

### Usage and Test

If you prefer to build it locally: 

1. Locally build the controller:

``` bash
$ make docker-build
$ make deploy IMG=your-image:tag
```

2. Annotate your workload:

```yaml
metadata:
  annotations:
    k8s.autoscaling.vpacreation/vpa-enabled: "true"
```

3. Deploy your workload and verify VPA creation:

```bash
$ kubectl apply <your_workload>.yaml
$ kubectl get vpa
```

### Full example

Below is an example with a nginx deployment:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: test-vpa
  namespace: tetris
  annotations:
    k8s.autoscaling.vpacreation/vpa-enabled: "true"
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: test
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: test
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: nginx
          image: nginx
```

## RBAC Requirements

The controller needs permission to:
- Read `Deployment`, `DaemonSet`, or `StatefulSet`;
- Create and delete `VerticalPodAutoscalers`

## Cleanup

VPAs are deleted automatically when their owning workload is deleted â€” no manual cleanup needed.
